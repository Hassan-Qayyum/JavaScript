/*                                        Looping over arrays

1- First approach is the traditional for loop.

2- Second approach is using for of loop.    */


// 1-   Traditional for loop

/*
for (let i=0; i<products.length;i++){
    // console.log(products[i]); // It will print all the products
    // console.log(products[i].id); // It will print all products ids
    // console.log(products[i].title); // It will print all products titles
    console.log(products[i]['title']); // It will print all products titles
}
*/

//  2-   Advance (for of loop) => It is more efficient way of loop than tradition for loop, in this loop we don't need to define length 

/*
for(let product of products){

    // console.log ("Returning All Products: ",product);
    // console.log("Returning Products ids: ", product.id);
    // console.log("Returning Products titles: ", product.title);
    // console.log("Returning Products ids: ", product['id']);
    console.log("Returning Products titles: ", product['title']);
}
*/

//  3-  Most commonly used => forEach loop (DrawBack: Does not return anything)

/*
products.forEach((product,index)=>{      // In forEach loop we are giving 'product' as an element of the products array and index is simple object
    
    product['id']= "ABC"; // output: id = "ABC" => It is replacing ids of all entries with ABC.
    console.log(product); // 
});


*/




/* Most Useful Methods (map (), filter()) => You will use following methods most commonly.

1-  map() (returns new data without manipulating original data)  ==> It works same as forEach loop but unlike forEach loop it returns data.


First Example: We are making a new array where we are putting status=true (for those products who have greater price than 100) and status=false (for those products who have lower price than 100)

*/

/*
const updatedProducts= products.map((product, index)=>{

    if(product.price >100){
        product.status = true;
    }
    else{
        product.status = false;
    }

    return product;
});

console.log ("updatedProducts: ",updatedProducts); // output: It will put status=ture or status=false at the end of each product.
*/

// Second Example: We are making a new array where we are getting status=true (for those products who have greater price than 100) and status=false (for those products who have lower price than 100)

/*
const updatedProducts= products.map((product, index)=>{

    return {
        price: product.price,
        title: product.title
    };
});

console.log(updatedProducts);
*/


// 2-  filter() ==> It filters arrays based on condition (Filter returns all the matching data in the form of array , if not result found then returns empty [])

/*

const updatedProducts = products.filter((product,index)=>{

    return product.price> 100;  // It is filtering products who have price greater than 100 

}).map(product => product.rating); // It is returning rating of all the filtered products 

console.log(updatedProducts); // It is displaying rating of all the filtered products.

*/


// 3-  find() ==> It finds an element in an array (returns undefined if the element is not found, else 'element'). It returns first match/occuerence

/*
let findingProductsWith_rating = products.find ((product,index,products)=>{
    return product.rating.rate === 2.1; // finding products with rating-rate of 2.1
});  

console.log (findingProductsWith_rating); // displaying the product with rating rate of 2.1
*/

/*
let findingProductsWith_rating = products.find((function(product, index, products){
    return product.rating.rate === 2.1;
}));

console.log (findingProductsWith_rating);
*/

/*
let findingProductsWith_rating = products.find((product,index) => { return product.rating.rate === 2.1});
console.log (findingProductsWith_rating);
*/

/*
let findingProductsWith_rating = products.find(product=> product.rating.rate === 2.1);
console.log (findingProductsWith_rating);
*/



// 4-  findIndex() ==> It finds an element in an array and return its index (returns undefined if the element is not found, else 'index'). It returns first index match

/*
let findingProductsWit_rating = products.findIndex(product=> product.rating.rate === 2.1);
console.log(findingProductsWit_rating);
*/
